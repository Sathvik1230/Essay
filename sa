Since the start of high school, I heard of Mass Academy as a highly competitive school. In the beginning, I thought Mass Academy was not a school for me as I thought that I would not be able to do anything other than academics. But after talking to some of my friends’ experiences with Mass Academy I completely changed my mind. I learned that there is so much more to Mass Academy than just academics. I have been very passionate about technology since I was a little kid and I found that at Mass Academy I can explore technology and create projects like never before. But something that really caught my attention was that the people at Mass Academy are like a family. I am a person who can fit into smaller groups of people better than big ones. I can better collaborate with teachers as the school is primarily a math and science subject-oriented school and both of these subjects are associated with my passion. With the help of the highly experienced teachers at Mass Academy I could greatly succeed in the science fair. Also, my learning won’t just be limited to the classroom, which is very important to me.
Mass Academy's emphasis on hands-on learning will help me to better understand the topics and go further with what I have learned. Because I am not an apprehensive person I can contribute my thoughts better in group projects and discussions which may impact my peers' views. After attending a Shadow Day I got first-hand experience on what a school day is like.
